# Writing For Developers

Structure your communication so developers remain on-task more easily and the pace does not dip.
AI writing has tells that not only obfuscates but also detracts from the actual content that's being written.

To ensure communication is as effective as possible, the following structure and rules are imposed.

## Content Structure

### Keep things actionable 

Lead with conclusions and actionable information. Senior developers prefer knowing what's next upfront.
If they need more context, they will read the rest of your message.
At the end, reiterate the leading action or name the immediate next action the developer must take, if applicable.



### Varying length creates flow

Reading content flows better when the content isn't always the same length.

- A shorter length emphasizes a point being made, longer lengths give context.
- One thought per sentence does not mean one length per sentence. Split the sentence that carries two thoughts. Keep the long sentence that carries one.
- Being specific will be more effective than sterile. Not "schema changes can cause issues" but "a column rename fails the build".
- After a paragraph of three or more sentences, when applicable, check that at least one is under ten words.

## Write sentences to the reader (Google developer style)

- Talk to the reader as "you", in the present tense. "Will" only for things that genuinely happen later.
- Say who does what: "the compiler checks", not "is checked". Passive is fine only when the actor is unknown or beside the point.
- Write instructions as commands: "Click Submit." State facts plainly. Never "should be done".
- Put the condition before the instruction: "To delete the document, click Delete."
- Put the common case first. Exceptions after.
- Sound like a knowledgeable friend. No buzzwords, no figurative language, no "please" in instructions, and never "simply", "easy", or "quickly" in a procedure. If it were simple, the reader would not be here.
- Don't pre-announce ("we will soon support...") and don't start consecutive sentences with the same phrase.
- Link with words that say where the link goes: the page title or a short description. Never "click here". Prefer a sentence of context on the page over a link off it.
- Headings carry the point, not just the topic ("Pick the mode first", not "Modes"). Sentence case. A task heading is a bare verb phrase ("Create an instance"). A concept heading is a noun phrase. One h1 per page, no skipped levels.
- Numbered lists for sequences, bullets for everything else. Introduce a list with a complete sentence. Keep items parallel.
- Code goes in code font. UI elements go in bold. Use serial commas. Drop "etc." and say up front that a list is partial.

## Make statements load one at a time (STE rules)

- One instruction per sentence. One thought per sentence everywhere else.
- Split instructions longer than about 20 words and other sentences longer than about 25.
- Put the warning or condition before the step it guards: "If hot oil touches your skin, injuries can occur."
- Keep "the" and "a": "Remove backup file" reads two ways. "Remove the backup file" reads one.
- Give each word one meaning and one job, then keep it. If "check" means inspect, don't also use it for restrain.
- Pick one word per action and stick to it: "start", not "start" here and "initiate" there.
- Write procedures as direct commands, never as narration and never in the passive: "Install the component", not "the component must be installed".
- Avoid "-ing" words where you can.

## Leave no sentence open to two readings (Global English)

- Keep words like "only" and "not" next to the word they change: "only fails on growth" and "fails only on growth" say different things.
- Break up long noun strings: "the proto import budget check script" becomes "the script that checks the proto-import budget".
- Make every "it", "they", and "this" point at one obvious thing. Repeat the noun when in doubt. Never use "this" or "which" to point at a whole clause.
- Don't drop verbs: "Phase 1 moves the converters and Phase 2 the runtime" leaves Phase 2 without one. Give it one.
- Keep the small words that show structure, such as "that" in "Ensure that the switch is off". Never trade clarity for word count.
- Repeat the article in a series when it prevents a misread: "the client and the host", not "the client and host", when they are two things.
- Say which parts "and" or "or" joins when a sentence can group two ways. "Both...and", "either...or", and "if...then" are free disambiguators.
- Use periods, not semicolons. Replace an em dash with a new sentence.
- Make text in parentheses a full grammatical unit or its own sentence. Never form plurals with "(s)".
- No slashes: write "a, b, or both" instead of "a/b" or "and/or".
- Call each thing by one name, everywhere. A doc that says "the gate", "the ratchet", and "the budget check" for one thing teaches three things. Don't churn what didn't change.
- Skip idioms, colloquialisms, Latin abbreviations, and metaphors.

## Patterns to detect and fix

Rule numbers are stable ids that other skills cite. A removed rule leaves a gap.

### Content

1. **Superficial -ing phrases.** "highlighting...", "ensuring...", "reflecting...", "showcasing...", "fostering...". Delete or expand with real sources.
2. **Vague attributions.** "Experts believe", "Industry reports suggest", "Some critics argue". Name the source or delete.

### Language

3. **AI vocabulary.** Additionally, crucial, delve, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, interplay, intricate, landscape (abstract), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract), testament, underscore, vibrant. Replace with plain words.
4. **Fancy ways to say "is".** "serves as", "stands as", "boasts", "features". Say "is" or "has".
5. **"Not just X, but Y."** State the point directly instead.
6. **Rule of three.** Don't force ideas into groups of three. Use the natural number.
7. **Synonym cycling.** Protagonist, main character, central figure, hero all in one paragraph. Pick one, repeat it.
8. **False ranges.** "from X to Y" where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale. List topics directly.

### Style

9. **Em dash overuse.** Avoid em dashes entirely. When an em dash separates two thoughts, end the sentence and start a new one. When it introduces an aside, either cut the aside or make it its own sentence. Use a comma only when the two parts were already one thought. Never substitute parentheses, en dashes, or hyphens.
10. **Colon overuse.** Colons are fine before a list or example, not as mid-sentence connectors. "If you're coming from traditional automation: instead of registering event handlers, you describe conditions" adds nothing with the colon. Rewrite to let the point stand on its own without comparison framing. "Describing when the scheduler should fire works best as plain English." Same meaning, no crutch punctuation.
11. **Boldface overuse.** Don't bold every proper noun or acronym.
12. **Inline-header lists.** The tell is a bold label and colon that restates the line: "**Performance:** Performance improved...". Convert those to prose. A bold lead-in that ends in a period, names the item, and is followed by genuinely new detail ("**Schema in TypeScript.** Tables live in one file.") is fine, not a tell.
13. **Title case headings.** Use sentence case.
14. **Decorative emojis.** Remove from headings and bullets.
15. **Curly quotes.** Use straight quotes.

### Communication artifacts

16. **Chatbot phrases.** "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if...", "Of course!", "Certainly!", "Found the smoking gun!" Remove.
17. **Sycophantic tone.** "Great question! You're absolutely right!" Respond directly.

### Filler

18. **Filler phrases.** "In order to" becomes "To". "Due to the fact that" becomes "Because". Delete "It is important to note that".
19. **Excessive hedging.** "could potentially possibly be argued that it might" becomes "may".
20. **Generic conclusions.** "The future looks bright." State specific plans or facts.

### Jargon

21. **Abstract metaphor nouns.** Substrate (base), wedge, wedge in (add), vector (way, method), locus, vantage, nexus, primitive as a noun, harness as a metaphor, bedrock, scaffolding as a metaphor, modality, paradigm, gold-plating (more than the job needs), ratchet as a metaphor (the mechanism's real name, or a limit that only tightens), evacuate for moving code (move out), endgame (the last phase), north star, flywheel. Surface as a verb or as "attack surface" is fine, "API surface" reads as jargon, prefer "the exported API" or "the public functions". These read as technical but usually have a plainer concrete word. Pick the concrete word.

### Plain speech

22. **Say what it does, not how it feels.** "the database stays close at hand", "SQL you can read", "types that follow your schema" name a feeling. The fix names the mechanism or a number: "`.toSQL()` returns the exact string sent to the database", "a column rename fails the build". Ask what the sentence tells the reader to do or know, then write that. If you can't restate it as a concrete instruction, fact, or number, cut it. One more check: if the sentence could appear unchanged in another project's docs, it says nothing about this one. Cut it.
23. **Shorten or split dense sentences.** If the reader has to backtrack to parse a sentence, break it in two or drop clauses. One idea per sentence.
24. **Active voice.** Prefer it. Catch "is/are/was/were + past participle" and name the actor: "queries are validated" becomes "the compiler validates queries", "the file is parsed by the loader" becomes "the loader parses the file". Passive is fine only when the actor is unknown or genuinely doesn't matter.
25. **Cut adverbs, or use a stronger verb.** "runs quickly" becomes "is fast" or the number, and "significantly improves" becomes the measured delta. An adverb propping up a weak verb means the verb is wrong.
26. **Prefer the plain word.** "utilize" and "leverage" become "use", "facilitate" becomes "help", "numerous" becomes "many", "in the event that" becomes "if". The fancier synonym is rarely clearer.
27. **Mannered prose.** Metaphor or flourish where a literal phrase exists: aphorisms ("wire it or delete it"), rhetorical fragments for effect, personified code ("the plan holds it"), figurative verbs ("rides along", "stands on"), stock framing phrases. "A dial worth turning" becomes "a parameter worth varying". Say what you mean. Rule 26 covers the metaphor nouns.
28. **Over-compression.** Dropped articles, verbless fragments, symbol-speak, and abbreviations that make the reader decode instead of read. "Parser rejects bad date → exit 2, no write" becomes "The parser rejects a bad date, exits with code 2, and writes nothing." Write whole sentences with their articles and verbs, and spell out arrows and abbreviations. A sentence that lost its em dash and became three comma clauses is the same problem in reverse. Split it.
